# My Personal Portfolio



This repository includes my Portfolio, About Me and Task-Manager.

The Task-Manager is built using Angular 8 and is already CRUD ready.

For the Back-End, I'm using Node.JS; which is in a private repository.

## Instructions:

Make sure to install the latest version of:
- [Node.JS & npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Run `npm i` to install all the necessary dependencies

## Accomplishments:

- Portfolio, About Me & Task Manager are fully responsive
- Basic & more in depth tests for each Component
- Dynamic SCSS mixins
- Deployed with HTTPS
